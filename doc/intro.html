<H2><A NAME="intro"></A>1. Introduction</H2>
<H3><A NAME="why"></A>1.1 Why S-expressions ?</H3>
<P>The SPOCP project has developed software for an <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN>
server. At the heart of the SPOCP server is a policy engine that
tests if an <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN> request from a
client ought to be allowed or not, given a set of policies. When
dealing with policies in computer systems one has to have a clear way
of describing the policies so that programs can test whether an entry
has a specific right or not. By choosing a syntax for the policies
and queries that is independent of the application area one can build
a policy evaluator which can work well for many applications. We
believe that S-expressions is such a language and have therefore
chosen it as the basis for our work with a general authorization
server. In addition we, as a convention, assume that both the policy
rules and the queries have the form of a Subject doing an Action on a
Resource.</P>
<H3><A NAME="history"></A>1.2 History of S-expressions</H3>
<P>The use of S-expressions for authentication/<SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN>
purposes can be traced back to 1997, when Ron Rivest published an
Internet draft [SEXP2] <SPAN LANG="en-US">describing</SPAN> their
basic data structure and encoding. And, as mentioned in that paper,
further back to work done on &quot;A Simple Distributed Security
Infrastructure&quot; (SDSI) in 1996 and possibly also back to the
LISP programming language. Later, &quot;The Simple Public Key
Infrastructure&quot; (SPKI) working group within the IETF, based its
work on Rivest's work, but made restrictions on the syntax of the
S-expressions to be used in that context.</P>
<P>In SPOCP, we are building on both of these works and are in our
turn further restricting the syntax. In this document, we describe
restricted S-expressions as we are using them.</P>
<P>A restricted S-expression is a nested list enclosed in matching
&quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;. The first element in the list is
always a &quot;tag&quot; or &quot;name&quot; of the object
represented by the list and must be a byte-string. With that
exception, every element in the list may in turn be an S-expression.
In comparison with the S-expression technology of [SEXP], we impose
the further restriction that no empty lists are allowed and that all
lists that appears in <STRONG><I>set</I></STRONG> constructions must
have different tags. An S-expression can also be interpreted as an
ordered tree: The tag is the root and its first subtree is the second
element in the list, and so on. As in SPKI, we have chosen Rivest's
compact &quot;canonical form&quot;, see [SEXP], as our internal
representation of an S-expression. In most of the examples we use the
&quot;advanced form&quot; which is easier to read.</P>
<P>SPOCP objects are defined below using ABNF [RFC 2234].</P>
<P>S-expressions are used at the core in the authorization server,
and may be sent between computers. If they are, the canonical form is
to be used [SEXP]. A canonical S-expression is formed from binary
byte strings (that is every byte can assume any <SPAN LANG="en-US">byte
value</SPAN> between and including 0x00 and 0xFF), each prefixed by
its length, and enclosed in parenthesis. The length of a byte string
is a non-negative ASCII decimal number, with no unnecessary leading
&quot;0&quot; digits, terminated by &quot;:&quot;. The canonical form
is a unique representation of an S-expression and is used as the
input to all hash and signature functions.</P>
<PRE>  s-expr      = &quot;(&quot; tag *s-part &quot;)&quot;
  tag         = octetstring
  s-part      = octetstring / s-expr / starform
  octetstring = decimal &quot;:&quot; 1*octet
                ; The number of octets should be equal to the decimal specification
  decimal     = nzdigit *digit
  nzdigit     = &quot;1&quot; / &quot;2&quot; / &quot;3&quot; / &quot;4&quot; / &quot;5&quot; / &quot;6&quot; / &quot;7&quot; / &quot;8&quot; / &quot;9&quot;
  digit       = &quot;0&quot; / nzdigit
  octets      = %x00-FF
  starform    = &quot;(1:*&quot; ( or / range / prefix / suffix / bcond ) &quot;)&quot;</PRE><P>
<BR>The specification of <SPAN LANG="en-US">star forms</SPAN> are
done further down in the document.</P>
<P><EM>Even though the canonical form is the one described by the
ABNF definitions, the so called advanced form will be used in the
examples since it is easier for humans to read. In the advanced form,
the elements are separated by spaces and there is no length prefix.</EM></P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>  (5:spocp(8:Resource6:mailer)) -- canonical form
  (spocp (Resource mailer))     -- advanced form</PRE><P>
These are two representations of the same S-expression, consisting of
a <SPAN LANG="en-US">octet string</SPAN> (the tag) &quot;spocp&quot;
and another S-expression, that consists of two <SPAN LANG="en-US">octet
strings</SPAN> &quot;Resource&quot; and &quot;mailer&quot;.</P>
<H2><A NAME="restricted"></A>2. Restricted S-expressions</H2>
<P>Apart from simple lists and <SPAN LANG="en-US">octet string</SPAN>,
we use so called <SPAN LANG="en-US">star forms</SPAN>, these are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">set</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">range</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">prefix</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">suffix</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"></P>
</UL>
<P>Even though the so called <SPAN LANG="en-US">star forms</SPAN> (
set, range, prefix and suffix) look like lists they are not. Set,
range, prefix and suffix are just a succinct way of representing
every element that fits into a specific set. So what they are, are
really sets of S-expressions. 
</P>
<H3><A NAME="or"></A>2.1 Set</H3>
<P>Described by the ABNF</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">  set = &quot;3:set&quot; 1*s-expr</PRE><P>
They are a way of specifying a limited set of elements, a choice.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">  (* set apple orange lemon)</PRE><H3>
<A NAME="range"></A>2.2 Range</H3>
<P>Since one needs to know the type when one deals with ranges, there
are a couple of types predefined.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;alpha&quot; which is normal
	text 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;numeric&quot;, non-negative
	numbers between 0 and 4294967295 (UINT32_MAX) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;date&quot;, date
	specification of the form YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS or in the notation
	used by strftime &ldquo;%G:%m:%d_%H:%M:%S&rdquo; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;time&quot;, time of day
	specification HH:MM:SS 
	</P>
	<LI><P>&quot;ipv4&quot;, the IPv4 address in the normal dot notation
	format (10.0.0.1) 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>In the specification of a range you may use constants in these
types in combination with relational operators in a <SPAN LANG="en-US">straight</SPAN>
forward way. The ABNF specification for range is:</P>
<PRE>  range          = &quot;5:range&quot; rangespec
  rangespec      = alpha / numeric / date / time / ipv4
  alpha          = &quot;5:alpha&quot; [lole utf8string [goge utf8string]] / [goge utf8string [lole utf8string]]

<H2><A NAME="ordering"></A>3. Ordering S-expressions</H2>
<P>In order to be able to model any kind of rights as a set of rules
in the form of S-expressions, we need to define a binary relation,
&lt;=, that can be used to order S-expressions. We want a relation
where A&lt;=B belongs to the relation if rule A is less permissive
than rule B. For many S-expressions, neither A&lt;=B nor B&lt;=A
belongs to the relation.. Once the relation is defined, we also need
an efficient way to decide (compute) if A&lt;=B. In SPKI [SPKI], an
algorithm to compute &quot;Intersection of tag sets&quot; is
specified. Applied to two rules, A and B, it evaluates to the less
permissive rule, if A&lt;=B or B&lt;=A. If there is no &lt;=-relation
between A and B, it evaluates to the empty S-expression. This type of
relation is called a &quot;preorder&quot;, and is characterised by
being reflexive and transitive, that is by satisfying the two
conditions:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If A is an S-expression then A &lt;=
	A is always true (reflexive) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If A, B and C are S-expressions that satisfies A &lt;= B and
	B &lt;= C, then it is also true that A &lt;= C (transitive) 
	</P>
</OL>
<P><EM>Note</EM> that if A and B are any S-expressions then there
exists three possible states for the <SPAN LANG="en-US">comparison</SPAN>
relation: A &lt;= B, B &lt;= A or neither. The most typical case is
that neither A &lt;= B or B &lt;= A is true.</P>
<P><EM>Note</EM> also that we will leave boundary conditions out of
the picture for a while.</P>
<P>Trying to define the <SPAN LANG="en-US">comparison</SPAN> relation
we will start with S-expressions without <SPAN LANG="en-US">star
forms.</SPAN> First some basic definitions:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For two <SPAN LANG="en-US">octet
	strings</SPAN> A and B, A &lt;= B only if A == B 
	</P>
	<LI><P>For a <SPAN LANG="en-US">octet string</SPAN> A and an
	S-expression B, it is neither the case that A&lt;= B nor B&lt;=A. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>Given these cases one can define the comparison between two <SPAN LANG="en-US">star
form</SPAN>-free S-expressions as:</P>
<P><STRONG>If S and T are *-free S-expressions, then S &lt;= T if S
has at least as many elements as T and every element in S is &lt;=
the corresponding element in T.</STRONG></P>
<P>Example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(fruit apple large red) &lt;=
	(fruit apple) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>(fruit apple (size large) red) &lt;= (fruit apple (size) red)
		</P>
</UL>
<P>and these are neither &lt;= nor &gt;=</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(fruit apple large red) compared
	to (fruit apple (large) red) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>(fruit apple large red) compared to (fruit apple red large) 
	</P>
</UL>
<P><EM>Note</EM> that order is absolutely vital</P>
<P>(apple (weight 100)(<SPAN LANG="en-US">color</SPAN> red)) is not
&lt;= (apple (<SPAN LANG="en-US">color</SPAN> red)(weight 100))</P>
<P>The relationship can also more formally be defined as:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">  (X<SUB>1</SUB> X<SUB>2</SUB> ... X<SUB>m</SUB>) &lt;= (Y<SUB>1</SUB> Y<SUB>2</SUB> ... Y<SUB>n</SUB>) if and only if n &lt;= m and X<SUB>i</SUB> &lt;= Y<SUB>i</SUB> for i = 1,...,n</PRE><P>
To do the more general comparison you have to go through a number of
steps and if anyone of them is true then the comparison is true. If
none is true then the comparison is false.</P>
<P>S &lt;= T, when S and T are elements of S-expressions, if:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">S and T are strings and S == T 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">S is a string and T is a <STRONG>range</STRONG>,
	<STRONG>suffix</STRONG> or <STRONG>prefix</STRONG>-form that

	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">S and T are <STRONG>suffix</STRONG>-forms
	where T contains S 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">S and T are lists that <SPAN LANG="en-US">fulfills</SPAN>
	the relationship defined above

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">S = (* set X<SUB>1</SUB> ... X<SUB>m</SUB>)

</OL>
<H2><A NAME="format"></A>4. Common format for S-expressions used in
SPOCP</H2>
<P>When describing rules and thereby queries we have chosen to
structure the rules into sub-expressions tagged with resource, action
and subject. This is form of expressing <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN>
rules that is frequent in many applications.</P>
<DL>
	<DT>Resource 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	The item someone/something wants to do something on 
	</DD><DT>
	Action 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	The action to be applied to the resource 
	</DD><DT>
	Subject 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	Who/what and under what circumstance this object wants to apply the
	specified action to the specified resource 
	</DD></DL>
<P>
Example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">  (spocp (resource mailer)(action send)(subject (email eva@minorg.se)))</PRE><P>
Which as a rule could be taken to mean that the user that has the
<SPAN LANG="en-US">email address</SPAN> 'eva@minorg.se' is allowed to
use a <SPAN LANG="en-US">specified</SPAN> <SPAN LANG="en-US">mail
server</SPAN> to send emails to anyone.</P>
<P>A query, on the same topic, could then be:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">  (spocp (resource mailer)(action send (to roland@dinorg.se))(subject (email eva@minorg.se)))</PRE><H2>
5. Notes on hierarchical names</H2>
<P>In many situations your application has <SPAN LANG="en-US">organized</SPAN>
and named both Sources, Actions and Resources as hierarchies. If you
want to take full advantage of the hierarchical names in rules and
queries you have to study carefully how S-expressions are evaluated
by the policy engine. Assume that a name is (name P <SUB>1</SUB> P <SUB>2</SUB>
... P <SUB>n</SUB> ) where P <SUB>1</SUB> is the part of the name
that is closest to the root of the hierarchy. Then you can represent
the whole space of names below P <SUB>1</SUB>, by just specifying the
top part of the <SPAN LANG="en-US">name space</SPAN>: (name P <SUB>1</SUB>).
Correspondingly you can represent a specific part of the <SPAN LANG="en-US">name
space</SPAN> by defining a larger part of the hierarchy (name P <SUB>1</SUB>
P <SUB>2</SUB> ... P <SUB>m</SUB>), m &lt; n.</P>
<P>But what if you'd like to represent everyone that has the same
last part P <SUB>n</SUB>. An example of when this would be is if you
defined role names within a organization as a concatenation of the
organization name, the name of all the organizational units from the
top with the <SPAN LANG="en-US">role type.</SPAN> Like this: (role O
OU <SUB>1</SUB> ... OU <SUB>n</SUB> R)</P>
<P>&quot;(role UmU Umdac boss)&quot; would then be the <SPAN LANG="en-US">role
name</SPAN> for the boss of the organizational unit Umdac within the
organization UmU.</P>
<P>Using this structure you could say (role UmU Umdac) and mean every
role within that organizational unit and all the organizational units
below. But if you said (role UmU boss ) you would refer to the boss
of UmU and not all the bosses within UmU. This since (role UmU umdac
boss) is not &lt;= (role UmU boss). So adding a role type to a list
of O and OU's would mean exactly that role at that level in the
organization.</P>
<P>If you instead would define the <SPAN LANG="en-US">role name</SPAN>
to be (role R O OU <SUB>1</SUB> ... OU <SUB>n</SUB> ), you could
address every specific <SPAN LANG="en-US">role type</SPAN> within the
organization by writing things like (role boss UmU), which would then
mean every 'boss' within the organization UmU. Which follows since
(role boss UmU OU) is &lt;= (role boss UmU). But you could not
specifically target the boss at UmU.</P>
<P>One can add complexity to this by using role types that are
hierarchical such that the name would be (role O OU <SUB>1</SUB> ..
OU <SUB>n</SUB> R <SUB>1</SUB> .. R <SUB>m</SUB>) or (role R <SUB>1</SUB>
.. R <SUB>m</SUB> OU <SUB>1</SUB> ... OU <SUB>n</SUB>). By using the
first form you could address every role within a role hierarchy at a
specific place in the organization hierarchy but not in the whole
organization tree. Using the later role you could address one whole
subtree of the role hierarchy anywhere within a subtree of the
organizational hierarchy.</P>
<PRE>  (role UmU admin finance) &lt;= (role UmU admin)
  (role UmU umdac admin) is not &lt;= (role UmU admin)
  and
  (role admin UmU umdac) &lt;= (role admin UmU)
  (role admin finance UmU) is not &lt;= (role admin UmU)</PRE><P>
Remember that the decision of the meaning of a particular rule is
taken when <SPAN LANG="en-US">modeling</SPAN> the <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN>
policy for a particular application. The Policy Engine does not know
anything about the application. It only compares queries to rules
according to <SPAN LANG="en-US">built in</SPAN> evaluation rules for
restricted S-expressions, as described in this document. What we are
discussing in this section are the consequences of choosing certain
meanings of a particular S-expression, given how the Policy Engine
tests for the &lt;=-relation. These properties of the Policy Engine
must be fully understood by those deciding the structures of rules
and queries.</P>
<P>When you have two hierarchies that are linked to each other it
might be best to decouple them and make two lists of them. (role (org
O OU <SUB>1</SUB> .. OU <SUB>n</SUB>)(type R <SUB>1</SUB> .. R <SUB>m</SUB>))
which gives you <SPAN LANG="en-US">freedom</SPAN> to express the
relationship &quot;any role <SPAN LANG="en-US">within</SPAN> a role
hierarchy anywhere within a organization hierarchy&quot;.</P>
<PRE>  (role (org UmU) (type admin finance)) &lt;= (role (org UmU) (type admin))
  (role (org UmU umdac) (type admin)) &lt;= (role (org UmU) (type admin))</PRE><P>
There is of course nothing that prevents you from using one <SPAN LANG="en-US">name
form</SPAN> in one set of rules and another form in another as long
as the queries you pose to the policy engine use the appropriate one.
What you should make certain though is that the form you choose gives
you the possibility to express exactly what you are aiming for.</P>
<H2><A NAME="example"></A>7. Example</H2>
<H3><A NAME="mailrelay"></A>7.1 <SPAN LANG="en-US">Mail relay</SPAN></H3>
<H4><A NAME="mailrelayProblem"></A>7.1.1 problem statement</H4>
<P>Due to the <SPAN LANG="en-US">misusage</SPAN> of <SPAN LANG="en-US">mail
servers</SPAN> on the Internet, many organizations have decided to
limit what kind of mails that can be routed through their <SPAN LANG="en-US">mail
server.</SPAN> Normally this amounts to ascertain that a mail either
has as originator someone within the organization or that the claimed
recipient belongs to the organization.</P>
<P>The problem then becomes: who belongs to the organization ?</P>
<P>One often used solution when it is the sender that is checked is
to make certain that the ip address of the host used by the client
belongs to the set of ip addresses that the organization owns/uses.
<BR>One drawback of such a check is that anyone that is able to send
a mail from a machine within the organization is regarded as a member
of the organization. By some this might be regarded as a feature by
other as a bug. We might also have the situation that the
organization may want to restrict the rights of certain persons
within the organization so that they can only send to certain
recipients or receive from specified senders. And of course anyone
knows about the much wanted possibility to restrict for instance spam
from reaching users mailboxes. But that problem is however not dealt
with in this example.</P>
<P>So summing up we have three tests that should be performed before
a mail is allowed to be forwarded by the organization's <SPAN LANG="en-US">mail
server</SPAN></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Does the sender or the receiver
	belong to the organization ? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is the Sender allowed to send mail
	to this recipient ? 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Is the receiver allowed to receive mail from this sender ? 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>If anyone of these questions are answered with <STRONG>no</STRONG>
then the mail should be rejected.</P>
<H4><A NAME="spocpsol"></A>7.1.2 SPOCP solution</H4>
<P>Normal SMTP communication gives access to the following
information:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">sender host address 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">sender mail address 
	</P>
	<LI><P>receiver mail address 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>If SMTP AUTH is used, authentication information is also present.
<BR>On a high level one could then specify the following SPOCP rules
to match the tests specified above</P>
<OL>
	<LI><PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">(spocp (resource mailrelay)(action mail)(subject knownUnrestrictedSender))</PRE>
	<LI><PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">(spocp (resource mailrelay)(action mail)(subject knownUnrestrictedReceiver))</PRE>
	<LI><PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">(spocp (resource mailrelay)(action mail allowedReceiver)(subject knownRestrictedSender))</PRE>
	<LI><PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">(spocp (resource mailrelay)(action mail allowedSender)(subject knownRestrictedReceiver))</PRE>
</OL>
<P>The problem then becomes defining knownUnrestrictedSender,
knownUnrestrictedReceiver, knownRestrictedSender,
knownRestrictedReceiver as well as allowedReceivers and
allowedSenders.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ack"></A>8. Acknowledgement</H2>
<P>The work on using S-expression for rights management was brought
to my attention by some <SPAN LANG="en-US">colleagues</SPAN> at the
Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS). Babak Sadighi had the
<SPAN LANG="en-US">original</SPAN> thoughts on right management, Olav
Bandmann brought S-expressions into the process and together with
Mads Dam he did the mathematical evaluation of the less permissive
relationship between S-expression that Spocp depends on.</P>
