<h1><a id="intro" name="intro">0. Introduction</a></h1>
This document assumes some basic knowledge on how S-expressions are
used to manage authorization. If you know very little about this you
would do well to read <a href="./intro.html">Introduction to
S-expressions</a>
before you dwell deeper into this document.<br>
The next thing is that you will probably not be interested in all of
this document since someone already have decided which authorization
setup
you should use. If that is not the case, please read <a
 href="implement.html">The implementers guide</a> to get more
information on pro and cons of choosing one setup before another.<br>
If you are still with me at this point you are definitely interested in
how to set up a authorization system for you application. So after
reading
through <a href="rules.html">creating rules</a> you can skip to the
section that
deals with your specific setup.<br>
<p>
Through out this document I will use the canonical S-expression format
when describing
exactly what is produced. In duscussions on transformations in some
case
I have choosen to use the advanced format since that is easier to read.
</p>
<p>All of the different implementations sofar loads the rules they are
going to
work with from a textfile when they start. This means that if you have
a
server that reads the textfile everytime it gets a query like the
Exim/Spocp
combination, updating takes care of itself. You just have to modify the
file,
save it and it will instantly be used. Other servertypes usually lives
longer which means that the probability is quite high that you would
like to
update the rules while the server is running. Therefore all servers are
built to discover if the rules file is changed and if so discard <em>all</em>
the old rules and read the new ones from the file. The updating will
not be
made instantaneous.

<h1><a id="native" name="native">1. Using the native SPOCP serve</a></h1>
<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
The native server is the most versatile server in the set. With it you
can
use the full power of S-expression as well as choose from a varity of
access ways. The native server can listen on Internet ports as well as
unix domain sockets and as protocol it can presently only used TCP. In
the future UDP might also be supported.
<h2>1.1 Configuration file</h2>

<h3>1.1.0 Server part</h3>
The server has to know a couple of things when it starts and these
things are
supposed to be learnt from the configuration file.<br>
The format of the configuration file is as follows:
<pre>
  line    = "[" keyword "]" CRLF
             / UTF8 CRLF
 
  keyword = "calist" / "certificate" / "clients" / "dhfile" / "entropyfile" /
            "logfile" / "passwd" / "port" / "privatekey" / "rulefile" /
            "threads" / "timeout" / "unixdomainsocket" / "sslverifydepth" /
             "pidfile" 

  CRLF    = %x0D %x0A

  UTF8    = %x01-09 / %x0B-0C / %x0E-7F / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4 / UTF8-5 / UTF8-6
  UTF8-1  = %x80-BF
  UTF8-2  = %xC0-DF UTF8-1
  UTF8-3  = %xE0-EF 2UTF8-1
  UTF8-4  = %xF0-F7 3UTF8-1
  UTF8-5  = %xF8-FB 4UTF8-1
  UTF8-6  = %xFC-FD 5UTF8-1
  
  quotechar = "\" ( "\" / hexpair )
  hexpair   = hexchar hexchar
  hexchar   = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F" /
              "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" 
  DIGIT     = &amp;x30-39&nbsp;
</pre>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note: </span>If
you quote characters in the configuration file then be advised that the
server will read the file and dequote the strings before loading the
S-expressions. This means that the length of "\44" is not 3 but 1.<br>
<br>
The meaning of the keywords are as follows:
<dl>
  <dt><b>calist</b></dt>
  <dd>File of PEM-encoded Server CA Certificates that can be used to
verifiy client certificates</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>certificate</b></dt>
  <dd>The file that contains the signed certificate that belongs to the
SPOCP server</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>clients</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifying who can do what with this SPOCP server.<br>
      The format is: 
<pre>
  client_aci = [ rulesetname *SP ] ":" *SP qlarb [ *SP ":" *SP host [ *SP ":" *SP cert ]]
  qlarb      = [ "q" ][ "l" ][ "a" ][ "r" ][ "b" ]
  host       = ipnum [ "/" mask ]
  ipnum      = 1*3DIG "." 1*3DIG "." 1*3DIG "." 1*3DIG
  DIG        = %x30-39
  mask       = ( [ %x31-32 ] %x30-39 ) / ( %x33 %x30-32 )
  cert         ; certificate DN
</pre>

       <dl><dt>b</dt><dd>BEGIN ( to use transactions )</dd></dl>
</dd>
<p>
<dd>
If clients is not define, any application anywhere can run any operation
on this server, provided that the rule ACI does not prohibit the
operation.
</dd>
<p>
<dd>
Some examples
<dl>
<dt>Allow queries from the homenetwork</dt>
<dd>:q:130.239.0.0/16</dd>
<dt>Allow application with the right certificate subjectDN, and
from within the homenetwork, to update the rules</dt>
<dd>:lad:130.239.0.0/16:C=SE, O=UmU, CN=.*
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>dhfile</b></dt>
  <dd>A Diffie-Hellman parameter file</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>entropyfile</b></dt>
  <dd>A file which can be used to feed the randomness function. On a
Linux system that has been running for a while this is almost never
needed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>logfile</b></dt>
  <dd>Where SPOCP should write the logfile entries</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>passwd</b></dt>
  <dd>The password necessary to unlock the private key of the SPOCP
server. If this not provided and the private key is protected by a
password then the server will ask for the password on startup.
Something which might be feasible/necessary/correct in some
circumstances. In others it is completely unworkable</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>port</b></dt>
  <dd>Which Internet port SPOCP should listen on. If this keyword is
defined the keyword "unixdomainsocket" must not be defined and vice
versa.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>privatekey</b></dt>
  <dd>The file that contains the privatekey that should be used by this
SPOCP server, this file can be the same as the one specified for the
certificate. But we strongly discourage this practice. Instead we
recommend you to separate the Certificate and the Private Key</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>rulefile</b></dt>
  <dd>Where the file containing the SPOCP rules are placed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>sslverifydepth</b></dt>
  <dd>From the OpenSSL documentation: This directive sets how deeply
mod_ssl
should verify before deciding that the
clients don't have a valid certificate.
    <p>The depth actually is the maximum number of intermediate
certificate issuers,
i.e. the number of CA certificates which are max allowed to be followed
while
verifying the client certificate. A depth of 0 means that self-signed
client
certificates are accepted only, the default depth of 1 means the client
certificate can be self-signed or has to be signed by a CA which is
directly
known to the server (i.e. the CA's certificate is under). </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>threads</b></dt>
  <dd>The number of threads the server will use to service requests.
This number is static, that is it will not change over time depending
on load.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>timeout</b></dt>
  <dd>The inactivity timeout. If a client has been silent for this long
(seconds) on a connection the server will unilaterly close down the
connection.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>unixdomainsocket</b></dt>
  <dd>Which unix domain socket spocp should listen on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Pidfile</b></dt>
  <dd>Where the server should write the process Id of the server</dd>
</dl>

<h3>1.1.2 Plugin part</h3>

The native server handles what we call boundary conditions through the use of 
plugins. Plugins are dynamically loaded software modules that is loaded at startup.
<p>
Since we don't know and can't guess what kind of plugins there are going to be in
the future we have only defined how you tell the server about plugins.
<p>
You are suppost to use the construct: 
<pre>
  "[" pluginname ":" key "]"
</pre>

There are a couple of keys that we have defined and then you are free to define
more for managing the configuration of your backend. The ones we have defined are:

<dl>
  <dt><b>filename</b></dt>
  <dd>The absolute pathname to the dynammic software module implementing the backend</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><b>test</b></dt>
  <dd>The function that should be invoked when this backend is used to evauate a boundary condition</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><b>init</b></dt>
  <dd>A function that should be run by the server on startup. This is if the backend needs to do
      some initialization before it is used for evaluation the first time
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><b>cachetime</b></dt>
  <dd>Definitions of the cachetime to use for different backends. The
first argument is the number of seconds, the second a string which will be matched agains the
string defining the arguments of the backend after the variable substitution</dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.2 Commandline options</h2>
<pre> spocp [-d num][-f file][-h]<br><br> num   = 1*digit<br> digit = %30-39<br> file  = 1*UTF8 ; filename<br></pre>
<h2><a id="rulefile" name="rulefile">1.3 Rulefile format</a></h2>
A formal definition:
<pre>  rulefile   = ( ruledef / comment / "" / definition / include ) CR<br>  ruledef    = [path] rule<br>  rule       = list / atom / variable<br>  list       = "(" atom *rule ")"<br>  atom       = len ":" val<br>  variable   = "$$(" key ")"<br>  key        = 1*(%x2A-7E)<br>  comment    = "#" *UTF8  <br>  definition = key *SP "=" *SP 1*( atom / rule )<br>  SP         = %x20 / %x09                      ; space or tab<br>  len        = %x31-39 *( %x30-39 )<br>  val        = 1*UTF8<br>  include    = ";include" filename              ; reference to another rule file<br>  path       = '/' *( pathpart )<br>  pathpart   = 1*dirchar '/'<br>  dirchar    = %x30-39 / %x41-5A / %x61-7A / '-' / '_' <br></pre>
A unformal definition: <br>
A rule file consists of zero or more variable definitions, comments and
rules. Variable definitions binds a value to a key, these keys can then
later on appear in other variable definitions or rule definitions. Like
this:
<pre>docroot = 3:usr5:local3:apache6:htdocs<br>friends = (1:*3:set5:diego3:ton4:javi4:sara)<br>mydocs  = $$(docroot)6:roland<br>#<br>(5:spocp(8:resource$$(docroot))(6:action1:0)(subject))<br>(5:spocp(8:resource$$(mydocs))(6:action1:0)(subject(4:user$$(friends)))<br></pre>
<p>
It is important to remember that the variables are replaced <em>when</em>
they appear
in a rule or a definition. So variable definitions has to appear before
they
are used.
</p>
<p> Furthermore, variables can be redifined, a new variable definition
with a key
that is already bound will have the effect that the value bound to that
key
will be replaced with the new value.
</p>
<p>Inclusion of other files are done where the reference to them appear
in the
text.
</p>
<p>Rules can be divided into rulesets, they way to ackomplish this is
to prepend the ruledefinition itself with a path name.

<h2><a id="pam" name="pam">2. Spocp as a Pluggable Authentication
Module (PAM) for Linux</a></h2>

<h3>2.1 Account queries to S-expression conversion</h3>
The information presented to the PAM module are service requested, on
what host,by who ( uid and gid ) and finally from where the request
came. It might come
from a tty or a completely other host.
    <p>From this information, S-expression of this form is constructed
(it is
are wrapped into several lines to make it more readable) : </p>
    <pre>(5:spocp<br>  (8:resource&lt;host&gt;)<br>  (6:action&lt;service&gt;)<br>  (7:subject(3:uid&lt;uid&gt;)(3:gid&lt;gid&gt;)(4:host&lt;wherefrom&gt;)))<br></pre>
    <br>
So a 'realworld' example of a query would then be (also wrapped): <br>
    <pre>(5:spocp<br>  (8:resource6:theano)<br>  (6:action7:useradd)<br>  (7:subject(3:uid3:501)(3:gid3:100)(4:host5:pts/2)))<br></pre>
    <br>
And one could imaging having a matching rule that could be : <br>
    <pre>(5:spocp<br>  (8:resource6:theano)<br>  (6:action7:useradd)<br>  (7:subject(3:uid(1:*5:range2:ge3:5002:le:600))(3:gid)(4:host(1:*6:prefix4:pts/))))<br></pre>
    <br>
The interpretation of this rule is that anyone with a user id between
500 and 600
connected to the machine through a tty with a name starting with "pty/"
is allowed
to run the command 'useradd'. If this was the only rule defined and
used then root
would not be able to run 'useradd' !
    <h2>2.2 PAM configuration file format</h2>
PAM separates the tasks of authentication into four independent
management groups:
    <ul>
      <li>account management; </li>
      <li>authentication management; </li>
      <li>password management; </li>
      <li>and session management. </li>
    </ul>
SPOCP is used for the <em>account</em>management, which is basically
for answering
queries like
    <ul>
      <li>has the user's password expired? </li>
      <li>is this user permitted access to the requested service? </li>
    </ul>
The second question to me looks more like authorisation than
authentication but then
what is in a word ? <br>
Anyway this type of questions are the rationale for using a
authorization system
like spocp in the PAM context.
    <p>There are two places where information about when and how a
module should be used. Either in /etc/pam.conf or in files in the
directory /etc/pam.d .If the directory exists then the file is ignored.
    </p>
    <p>The format of each rule is a space separated collection of
tokens, the
first three being case-insensitive: </p>
    <pre>  service  type  control  module-path  module-arguments<br><br></pre>
The syntax of files contained in the /etc/pam.d/ directory, are
identical
except for the absence of any service field. In this case, the service
is
the name of the file in the /etc/pam.d/ directory. This filename must
be
in lower case.
    <p>More information on PAM can be gotten on any Linux system by
running "<b>man pam</b>" </p>
    <p>Below is a example on how to configure PAM to use the spocp
module when authenticating
the use of the command <em>useradd</em>. This is the content of the
file /etc/pam.d/useradd : </p>
<pre>
#%PAM-1.0
auth     sufficient     pam_rootok.so
auth     required       pam_permit.so
account  required       pam_spocp.so   \
        spocpserver=theano.catalogix.se:3456 \
        ssl \
	privatekey=/usr/local/spocp/certs/pam.pem \
        calist=/usr/local/spocp/certs/cacert.pem passwd=pampem \
	certificate=/usr/local/spocp/certs/pam.pem
account  required       pam_permit.so
password required       pam_permit.so
session  required       pam_deny.so
</pre>

Notice that if the PAM module should use TLS to protect the
communication with the
SPOCP server then all relevant information, like where the certificate
and private key of the client are place, has to be provided in the
configuration file.
If <em>ssl</em> is not defined as an argument then TLS is not used.<br>
So, as another example, if the PAM module is suppost to talk to the
server over a
unix domain socket on the same machine ( in which case TLS seems quite
unnecessary )
the spocp line in the configuration file would become:
    <pre>account  required       pam_spocp.so    spocpserver=/tmp/spocp <br><br><br></pre>

<h1><a id="apache_mod" name="apache_mod">3. Spocp as
accesscontrol system for a Apache server</a></h1>

<h2>3.1 Apache configuration: (httpd.conf)</h2>
This directive is suppost to be used inside &lt;Directory&gt; or &lt;Location&gt;
within *.conf files. It can not be used in .htaccess.
&lt;/Location&gt;&lt;/Directory&gt;
<p>

  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>serverlocation</dt>
<dd>
serverlocation is where the spocp server can be found, this is either
host:port ( remember there is no default spocp port ) or a unix domain
socket specification.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>3.2 Defining the Spocp rules</h2>
There are 5 different cases when it comes to http requests:
    <ol>
      <li> http without authentication
      </li>
      <li> http with authentication
      </li>
      <li> https without authentication
      </li>
      <li> https with user authentication
      </li>
      <li> https with client certificate authentication
      </li>
    </ol>
Depending on which one is in use, the webserver has access to different 
types of information. This means that the webserver will build different
Spocp queries depending on which case is in use. The name
of the resource that is requested is always present together with the
spocp domain name. Apart from that the following information is present
in the different cases:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>http without authentication</b></dt>
  <dd> client ip address and</dd>
  <dd> possibly client domain name</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>http with authentication</b></dt>
  <dd> client ip address, </dd>
  <dd> possibly client domain name, </dd>
  <dd> user name, </dd>
  <dd> authentication domain name and</dd>
  <dd> authentication type</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>https without authentication</b></dt>
  <dd> client ip address,</dd>
  <dd>possibly client domain name and</dd>
  <dd>whether SSLv2, SSLv3 or TLSv1 is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>https with user authentication</b></dt>
  <dd> client ip address,</dd>
  <dd>possibly client domain name,</dd>
  <dd>user name, </dd>
  <dd>authentication domain name, </dd>
  <dd>authentication type and </dd>
  <dd>whether SSLv2, SSLv3 or TLSv1 is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>https with client certificate authentication</b></dt>
  <dd> client ip address,</dd>
  <dd> possibly client domain name,</dd>
  <dd> subjectname from the client certificate,</dd>
  <dd> issuername from the client certificate,</dd>
  <dd> and whether SSLv2, SSLv3 or TLSv1 is used.</dd>
  <dd> If SSLOption +fakeBasicAuth is specified the client certificate subjectname also appears as user name.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Whether domain name will be available or not depends on what DNS
contains. The module will do a DNS lookup and then do a double reverse
lookup. The result is the (double reverse checked) hostname, or NULL if
any of the lookups fail. The construction of the Spocp query follows the
default 3-tuple contruct with separate parts for resource, action and subject.<br>
The different part are constructed as follows :
<p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>resource:</b></dt>
      <dd>spocpdomain and resourcename</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>action:</b></dt>
      <dd>action as number, 0 (GET), 1(PUT), 2(POST), and so on</dd>
      <dd>and access control (1) or authorization check</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>source:</b></dt>
      <dd>ipnumber hostname [sslversion [issuerDN subjectDN]] [user
authname authtype]</dd>
    </dl>
<p>
A typical Spocp query (split into several lines to make it more
readable)
<p>
<pre>
  (5:spocp
    (8:resource
     3:www                              ; spocp domain
     10:index.html1:-                   ; resource name (index.html)
    )
    (6:action1:01:0)                    ; 0 = GET, 0 = access check
    (7:subject
      (2:ip14:213.79.154.114)           ; client ip
      (4:host2:se9:catalogix6:theano)   ; client hostname
    )
  )
</pre>
<p>
And after a https request, after
authentication has completed. No client certificate demanded.
<p>
<pre>
  (5:spocp
    (8:resource
     9:internal                         ; spocp domain
     9:internal10:index.html1:-         ; resource name (internal/index.html)
    )
    (6:action1:01:1)                    ; 0 = GET, 1 = authorization check
    (7:subject
      (2:ip14:213.79.154.114)           ; client ip
      (4:host2:se9:catalogix6:theano)   ; client hostname
      (7:sslvers3:300)                  ; SSLv3
      (4:user6:roland)
      (8:authname6:secret)
      (8:authtype5:Basic)
    )
  )
</pre>
<p>
<b><em>Beware!</em></b> that in Apache access control really consists of tree
parts; access control, identity control and authorization control. This
means that if you have a protected part of you webserver where you demand authentication
and authorization.  Then you will get two Spocp queries. The first a
access check ( without any user, authtype and authname specifications )
and the second one a authorization check with user, authtype and authname.
The mod_spocp implementation allows you to
distinguish between these by adding a '0' element to the action list if it
is a access check and a '1' if it is a authorisation check.

<h2>3.2 A simple example </h2>

Given a httpd.conf with the following parts:

<pre>
DocumentRoot "/srv/www/htdocs"

&lt;Directory "/srv/www/htdocs"&gt;
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride None

    Spocp docs /tmp/spocp
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

Having the simple ruleset: <br>
(5:spocp(8:resource4:docs)(6:action1:0)(7:subject)) <br>
in the Spocp server would allow anyone access to the top directory.
<p>
So a request for http://127.0.0.1/index.html, which would generate the query:

<pre>
(5:spocp
  (8:resource4:docs10:index.html1:-)
  (6:action1:0)
  (7:subject(2:ip9:127.0.0.1)(4:host9:localhost))
)
</pre>
would be permitted.
<p>
Let us add another directory to the HTTP server,
<pre>
&lt;Directory /srv/www/htdocs/local&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName company
  AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/passwd
  Require valid-user
  Spocp protect /tmp/spocp
  Satisfy all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

A request came for http://127.0.0.1/local/images.html would be translated into this
SPOCP query 

<pre>
(5:spocp
  (8:resource7:protect5:local11:images.html1:-)
  (6:action1:01:0)
  (7:subject(2:ip9:127.0.0.1)(4:host9:localhost))
)
</pre>

Which would be denied imeediately (given the simple ruleset above)
<p>
So we would have to change our rules to:
<p>
<pre>
(5:spocp(8:resource4:docs)(6:action1:0)(7:subject))
(5:spocp(8:resource7:protect)(6:action1:0)(7:subject(2:ip9:127.0.0.1)(4:host9:localhost)))
</pre>

if we wanted to give the right people access to the resouce<br>
With this ruleset in place the request would be granted since both the access and the
authorization queries would be matched by the same rule (the second one).<br>
The queries would look like this:
<pre>
(5:spocp
  (8:resource7:protect5:local11:images.html1:-)
  (6:action1:01:0)
  (7:subject(2:ip9:127.0.0.1)(4:host9:localhost))
)

(5:spocp
  (8:resource7:protect5:local11:images.html1:-)
  (6:action1:01:1)
  (7:subject
    (2:ip9:127.0.0.1)
    (4:host9:localhost)
    (4:user6:roland)
    (8:authname7:company)
    (8:authtype5:Basic)
  )
)
</pre>

Changing your rules again to:

<pre>
(5:spocp(8:resource4:docs)(6:action1:0)(7:subject))
(5:spocp(8:resource7:protect)(6:action1:01:0)
  (7:subject(2:ip9:127.0.0.1)(4:host9:localhost)))
(5:spocp(8:resource7:protect)(6:action1:01:1)
  (7:subject(2:ip9:127.0.0.1)(4:host9:localhost)(4:user6:roland)))
</pre>

To separated the access control queries from the authorization control queries, but 
also to explicitly specify who should be granted access.<br>
'roland' with these rules in place would still be ganted access to the page but
'eva' who has a valid user at the HTTP server ( and therefore would pass the
first two checks, the access and identity check) would not ( since she would
fail on the authorization check).
