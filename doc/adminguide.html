<H1><A NAME="intro"></A>0. Introduction</H1>
<P>This document is written for someone who wants to use a SPOCP
server either as a authorization server or as a policy engine in some
application context. 
</P>
<P>The document assumes some basic knowledge on S-expressions and how
they can be used to manage authorization. If you know very little
about this you would do well to skim through <A HREF="draft-hedberg-spocp-sexp-00.html">Introduction
to S-expressions</A> before you dwell deeper into this document. 
</P>
<P>Through out this document I will use the canonical S-expression
format when describing exactly what is produced. In discussions on
transformations I have chosen, in some case, to use the advanced
format since that is easier to read. 
</P>
<H1><A NAME="compile"></A>1. Compiling spocd</H1>
<P>Normally all it would take is to run 
</P>
<PRE>./configure
make
make install</PRE><P>
<BR>This would compile the package, with all the plug ins that are
supported by libraries already installed on your system, and then
place the binaries and libraries in subdirectories to
&quot;/usr/local/spocp&quot;. 
</P>
<P>If that standard way is not sufficient in your case, my best
proposal is that you do 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">./configure --help</PRE><P>
and then use the options that applies in your case. 
</P>
<H1><A NAME="native"></A>2. Configuring the SPOCP serve</H1>
<H2>2.0 Introduction</H2>
<P>The Spocd server can listen on Internet ports as well as Unix
domain sockets and as protocol it can presently only use TCP. In the
future UDP might also be supported. 
</P>
<H2>2.1 Configuration file</H2>
<H3>2.1.1 Server part</H3>
<P>The server has to know a couple of things when it starts and these
things are supposed to be learned from the configuration file. If the
configuration file is 'empty' it has some default values for some of
the configurable things.<BR>The format of the configuration file is
as follows:

2.1.2 Plugin part</H3>
<P>The native server handles what we call boundary conditions through
the use of plug ins. Plug ins are dynamically loaded software modules
that are loaded at startup. 
</P>
<P>Since we don't know and can't guess what kind of plug ins there
are going to be in the future we have only defined how to tell the
server about plug ins. 
</P>
<P>As with Apache plug ins, the plug in library contains information
about which assignments you can make and what the keywords are.</P>
<P>There are a couple of keys that we have defined that can be used
by all plug ins:

	Every plug in can have a connection pool connected to it. It can use
	this pool to store open connections to information resources it uses
	for the future. This instead of closing and opening connections for
	each query. Here you can define how big the pool should be for each
	plug in separately. If you do not define a poolside for a plug in,
	that plug in will not be able to store connections for later use

<P>If a dback is defined, then if the persistent store is not
initialized the rules are read from the rule file. If on the other
hand it is in existence the rules will be read from the persistent
store and whatever is in the rule file will be ignored. During
operation if rules are added or deleted the persistent store will be
updated accordingly.</P>

	spocd [-d debug-level][-f config-file][-D][-t] 
	</DD><DT>
	Description 
	</DT><DD>
	Spocd is the standalone SPOCP daemon. It listens for SPOCP
	connections on Internet or Unix domain sockets, responding to
	operations received over such connections. Spocd is typically
	invoked at boot time, usually out of /etc/rc.local. Upon startup,
	spocd normally forks and disassociates itself from the invoking tty.
	The spocd process will print its process ID (see getpid(2)) to a
	.pid file unless something else is defined in the configuration file
	the pid file will be named &quot;spocd.pid&quot;. 
	</DD><DT>
	Options 
	</DT><DL>
		<DT>
		-d <U>debug-level</U> 
		</DT><DD>
		Turn on debugging as defined by num. <U>debug-level</U> is taken as
		a bit string, with each bit corresponding to a different kind of
		debugging information. 
		</DD><DT>
		-f <U>config-file</U> 
		</DT><DD>
		specifies the spocd configuration. The default is &quot;config&quot;
		in the directory where spocd is started. 
		</DD><DT>
		-D

		Do not daemonize. If this option is set, the spocd process will <B>not</B>
		disassociate itself from the invoking tty.

		-t 
		</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">

<B>Note:</B> Inclusion of other files are done where the reference to
them appear in the text. 
</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> Rules can be divided into rule sets, they way to
accomplish this is to prepends the rule definition itself with a path
name. This is normally not used for application rules but definitely
for the access rules for the Spocp server itself. The default base
for access rules to the Spocp server is &quot;/&quot;&lt;hostname&gt;&quot;/operation&quot;
for operation access rules and &quot;/&quot;&lt;hostname&gt;&quot;/server&quot;
for access to the server itself. In the example above Spocp clients
with IP addresses 213.79.154/24 or 127.0.0.1 are allowed access to
the Spocp server. These servers has as long as they are not using
SSLv3 not access to any other command than STARTTLS. Using TLS/SSL
they have access to the &quot;QUERY&quot; and &quot;LOGOUT&quot;
operations.</P>
