<h2><a id="summary" name="summary">1. Executive Summary</a></h2>
</b>
<p>Spocp is built using a welldefined syntax (S-expression) to
represent the authorization policy for a resource. I can be used ether
as library linked directly into the application or&nbsp; as a local or
Internet based service in either case the connection can be guarded by
using the SSL/TLS connection protocol. When a autorization decision
needs to be made, Spocp uses the information provided in the request as
well as external information, needed to evaluate constraints in the
policy rules, in order to determine whether the requst is to be granted
or not.<br>
</p>
The Spocp&nbsp; usage model followes the so called push sequence model,
that is the user connects to the resource and the resources checks with
Spocp to find out if the user is allowed to use the resource in the way
she wants to.<br>
<br>
Spocp can act as a standalone server whithout any dependencies on other
resources.<br>

<h2> <a id="background" name="background">2. Background</a> </h2>
</b>
<p>With the continued development of Internet based application
services, it is no longer   only the experts in an application field or
on an information system that are   users of the systems.<!--In order to take advantage of the self-service features,
  and to exploit the possibility to support the steps in our work processes, a
  large fraction of the personnel and persons that in other ways are affiliated
  with our organisation has to become users of our systems.-->
Instead more and more of the functions of a organisation is dependent on
the self-service features of   these applications. They are to a large
extent supporting the everyday work process.   We are therefore quickly
approaching a situation where every member of every community affiliated
with our organisation   need to be a user of our major information
systems. Up until now this has ursually meant maintaining really large,
separate, Authorisation Systems (Access Control Systems) one for each of
our Application Systems. </p>
<p>Our, and many other's, analysis of this problem is that we   need to
start a development process aiming at a situation where, at least the
"amateur", user automatically are given authorities in our systems
through means based on attributes, characterising or describing the
individual, rather than on the identity of the particular individual.</p>
<p>To reach that goal, we need</p>
<ul>
  <li>a good record of who belongs to our community</li>
  <li>knowledge of what attributes and other information that
characterise the members of our community</li>
  <li>a policy for how these attributes are assigned</li>
  <li>an Information System where these attributes can be safely managed</li>
  <li>an attribute or role based Authorisation System, that can     be
served these attributes from a database or a directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>SPOCP is an Authorisation Server designed to solve the last one of
these bullets. It is designed as a Network Based Infrastructural Service
(a Middleware service) and we believe that SPOCP will prove quite
useful, in different   deployment models, for a variety of applications
and application environments.<br>
It is worth noting that SPOCP is designed to be able to use external
information resources,   like a enterprise directory, when evaluating
policies. So in most cases there should not be any   need for
duplicating information into SPOCP that is already present in some
accessible information resource. </p>
<b>
<h2> <a id="approach" name="terminology"></a>3. Terminology and
framework<br>
</h2>
</b>
<p>While describing SPOCP we will use terminology and framework as
defined in RFC 2904. <br>
</p>
<p>The Spocp server is designed to work in what in RFC 2904 is termed
the 'Pull Sequence', that is</p>
<ol>
  <li>The user sends a request to the Service Equipment,</li>
  <li>which forwards it to the Service Provider's AAA server (Spocp in
this case),</li>
  <li>which evaluates the request and returns a appropriate response to
the Service Equipment,</li>
  <li>which sets up the service and tells the User it is ready
(assuming of course that the response from the AAA server was positive )</li>
</ol>
<pre>      <br>                          +-------------------------+<br>            +------+      | Service Provider        |<br>            |      |      |  +-------------------+  |<br>            |      |      |  |    AAA Server     |  |<br>            |      |      |  |                   |  |<br>            |      |      |  +-------------------+  |<br>            | User |      |         /|\  |          |<br>            |      |      |          |2  |3         |<br>            |      |      |          |  \|/         |<br>            |      |   1  |  +-------------------+  |<br>            |      |------+-&gt;|      Service      |  |<br>            |      |&lt;-----+--|     Equipment     |  |<br>            |      |   4  |  +-------------------+  |<br>            +------+      |                         |<br>                          +-------------------------+<br><br></pre>
Also as specified in RFC 2904 <br>
<pre>  In general, it is assumed that the parties who are participating in<br>  the authorization process have already gone through an authentication<br>  phase.&nbsp; The authentication method used by those parties is outside<br>  the scope of this document except to the extent that it influences&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>  the requirements found in a subsequent authorization process.<br>
</pre>
<h2><a name="4._Design_background"></a>4.Spocp policy language<br>
</h2>
Very basic to the design of the SPOCP Authorisation Server was the
choice of S-expressions as the syntax for how to express rules as well
as requests. This approach was first conceived in work done by a group
within the <a href="http://www.sics.se/">Swedish Institute of Computer
Science</a>. S-expressions was to our knowledge first described by <a
 href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/%7Erivest/sexp.html">Lampson and Rivest</a>
in 1996, but its origin can be traced back further to that of LISP.
S-expressions was brought to our attention through the work of the SPKI
working group within the IETF.<br>
<br>
It has been shown by&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Epki02/Bandmann/">Bandmann and Dam</a>
that a authorisation system based on restricted S-expression will always
return a correct answer.&nbsp; Work by the SICS <a
 href="http://www.sics.se/isl/pbr/papers/ConstraintDelegation.ps">group</a>
is also behind our approach to delegation.<br>
<br>
In a internet draft from 1997 <a
 href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/%7Erivest/sexp.txt">Rivest</a> he
describs three different representations of S-expression: canonical,
basic transport and advanced transport. The Spocp client protocol uses
the canonical representation while we in this document will use the
advanced transport representation, because it is much more user
friendly. We have also choosen to leave out "display hints" since we
really think that 'normal' users should never have to see S-expressions.<br>
<br>
An example of a S-expression policy rule is&nbsp; :<br>
<pre>(spocp (resource etc passwd)(action write)(subject (uid 0)))<br></pre>
Which would mean that the subject with uid 0 has write access to
/etc/passwd.<br>
<br>
S-expressions has a well defined syntax but no defined semantics, that
together with the fact that one can build a engine that can compare two
S-expressions and answer the question whether one is equal or more
specific than the other&nbsp; is the basis of the SPOCP policy engine. <br>
<br>
To understand how this work one has to understand that a S-expression
is made more specific by adding a item <br>
to the end of a list.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(resource etc password )</span> is for
instance more specific than <span style="font-style: italic;">(resource
etc) </span> <br>
<br>
Adding a item at some other place in a list creates a different
S-expression which is neither equal or more specific:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(resource usr etc)</span> is neither
equal of more specific than <span style="font-style: italic;">(resource
etc)</span>. It is just different.<br>
<h2><a name="5_Implementation_issues_"></a>5. Implementation issues </h2>
In order to make SPOCP really usefull, we have refrained from
specifying exactly one way of implementing the service. Instead SPOCP
comes in   a number of different shapes. Differing in the closeness to
the application and   also in the access protocol. In closeness order:
<ul>
  <li>As a <em>library</em> which can be linked together with your
application. A simple   C API consisting of a small set of function
calls are provided.</li>
  <li>A <em>standalone server</em> that can listen to a unix domain
socket or a internet   IPv4/v6 port. Using TCP as transport protocol.
The access protocol   is the SPOCP client access protocol.</li>
  <li> As an <em>Apache module</em> - mod_spocp - with the Policy Engine
being a   separate library module with   a specified API. The
Client/Server protocol for this combination is SAML/SOAP over HTTP. </li>
</ul>
Why you would choose one setup instead of another are factors like:
<ul>
  <li><b>speed</b>
    <ul>
      <li>having to connect another server always takes more time than
doing things locally, </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>manageability</b>
    <ul>
      <li>having SPOCP processes running on central systems managed by
professionals, will probably   give you better uptime. It will also make
it easier to get new applications covered by the authorisation system
since the environment already is there.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Security</span>
    <ul>
      <li>In some cases revealing the traffic pattern between a
application and a policy server is sensitive information <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> We have choosen to maintain and store rules in a policy repository
that is tightly coupled to the policy engine. So in our world the
authorisation server&nbsp; always has all the policies in local storage.<br>
<br>
Some of the information needed to set up a complete Policy may not be
available when the modelling is done, or there may be other reasons that
some information may be best provided through an external information
source   at the time of testing whether a Query complies. This often
occurs when a Constraint   is involved in the compliance test. SPOCP
offers the possibility of using what we term boundary conditions.
Examples of such conditions are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>date and time<br>
  </li>
  <li>information in a enterprise directory</li>
  <li>information in databases and/or files <br>
  </li>
  <li>information in DNS ( for example Realtime Blackhole Lists )<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<b>
<h2> <a id="policies" name="policies">6. Creating Policies</a></h2>
</b>
<p>As stated above the SPOCP policy engine does not care about the
semantics of the policy or request expressions. The policy engine only
cares about whether the rules and requests follow the S-expression
syntax . Even so, as a convention we have sofar used a structure where
the S-expressions consists of three parts: Subject, Action and Resource,
the following presentation is therefore tinted by that choice. <br>
</p>
<p>Semantics are up to the application experts to define.<br>
</p>
<p>In the process of modelling the Policy structure for a particular
application, the key to success is to be able to identify hierarchies
among the Subjects, Actions and Resources and to use these hierarchies
to express the Policy as comprehensive, small set of rights. The
ambition shall   be that every Right in a Policy Rule shall be as
permissive as possible. Given   a Query, the Policy Engine determines if
there is a Rule in the Policy that   has the same structure as the Query
and that is more permissive than the Query - that is a Rule that permits
the request implied in the Query.<br>
<br>
Examples of policies that Spocp can handle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only staff working at a specific department within a specified
organization can access this webpage</li>
  <li>Students only have access to these rooms during normal working
hours.</li>
  <li>This mailserver will only relay mail to and from email addresses
that are registered in a specific enterprise directory.</li>
</ul>
Below one&nbsp; example on how one might structure rules for particular
applications is given.<br>
<h3>6.1 WWW policy structure</h3>
In this example we are using&nbsp; the resource, action and subject
split as the basis for defining the S-expression structure.<br>
<h4><big>6.1.1 www subject</big></h4>
Connections between a web client and a web server can be of 5 different
types:<br>
<ol>
  <li>http</li>
  <li>https</li>
  <li>http + username,password auth</li>
  <li>https + username,password auth</li>
  <li>https + auth through client certificate usage<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Depending on which type the connection are the webserver has different
information on the client available :<br>

Given this matrix the general S-expression definition of the subject
could be:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(subject (ip &lt;ipnumber&gt;)(host
&lt;hostname&gt;)(ssl &lt;version&gt;)(uid &lt;userid&gt;)(authname
&lt;authname&gt;)(authtype &lt;authtype&gt;)(subjectdn
&lt;subjectdn&gt;)(issuerdn &lt;issuerdn&gt;))</span> <br>
<br>
In case of a http connection the subject part of the request would then
become something like this:<br>
(subject (ip 213.79.154.116)(host hypatia.catalogix.se))<br>
<h4><big>6.1.2 www action</big></h4>
The methods recognized by a web server might differ from server to
server. In this context we might limit ourself to stating that each
method is represented by a number, GET = 0, PUT = 1, POST = 2&nbsp; and
so on. The action definition would then become:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(action &lt;num&gt;)<br>
<br>
(action 0) </span>would the represent the method GET.<br>
<h4><big>6.1.3 www resource</big><br>
</h4>
Here there is a choice, one can either use the filenames as they are
"/staff/index.html" or one can split the name into its parts "staff" and
"index.html". In our mod_spocp implementation we have choice the later.
So the resource definition is:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(resource &lt;filename part1&gt;
&lt;filename part2&gt; ...)<br>
<br>
(resource public pictures rose.gif) </span>would then represent the
file &lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/public/picture/rose.gif&nbsp; .<br>
<br>
All put together a GET request for the rose.gif file from a webclient
at the host&nbsp; hypatia.catalogix.se would then lead to the following
S-expression being sent to the Spocp server for evaluation:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(spocp (resource public pictures
rose.gif)(action 0)(subject (ip 213.79.154.116)(host
hypatia.catalogix.se)))</span> <br>
<br>
If the Spocpserver had the following rule in it's policy database:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(spocp (resource staff)(action
0)(subject (ip)(host)))<br>
<br>
</span>Then the request would be granted.<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span>
<h2><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span><b><a id="externinfo"
 name="externinfo">7. The need to access external information<br>
</a></b></h2>
In lots of cases information, that is needed when a policy is to be
inforced, is not present at the time when the rules as defined.
Therefore a way of 'referencing' this external information is needed.
We have choosen to implement it as constrains that can be included in
the rules and which are evaluated/computed at the time when a request
is evaluated.<br>
<br>
Equally common is the case that information is already managed
somewhere else. The organization might have a enterprise directory
where it keeps information about users, groups, roles, organization
structure and copying this information into rules might cause more
problems then it solves.<br>
<br>
Also, if you want to make rules active only at certain times, it might
be more effective to defined the time constrains in the rules and then
have them checked on evaluating the requests instead of adding and
removing them as the time goes.<br>
<h2> <a id="appdel" name="appdel">8. Appointment and Delegation</a></h2>
To illustrate the approach let R<sub>0</sub> be some authorisation such
as the right to read document D. <br>
The unspecific right to read document D can be expressed in a
S-expression as:<br>
<pre>(spocp (resource D)(action read)(subject))<span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span></pre>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Then the rule that allows A to
delegate the right can be expressed as <span
 style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span>
<pre>(spocp (resource R<sub>0</sub>)(action delegate)(subject A))<br></pre>
Now, if we who have supreme power wants to give A the right to delegate
to B to delegate to someone within the group G the right to read the
document B, then this will be done through the chain:<br>
<pre>R0: (spocp (resource D)(action read)(subject (group G)))</pre>
<pre>R1: (spocp (resource R0)(action delegate)( subject B))</pre>
<pre>R2: (spocp (resource R1)(action delegate)( subject A))<br></pre>
Obvious from this example is that the right to delegate a right never
implicitly gives the right to use a right. B or for that matter A, is
according to the chain above no allowed to read the file D unless they
belong to the group G.<br>
