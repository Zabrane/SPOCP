Executive Summary</H2>
<P>Spocp is built using a <SPAN LANG="en-US">well
defined</SPAN> syntax (S-expression) to represent the authorization
policy for a resource. It can be used either as library linked
directly into the application or&nbsp; as a local or Internet based
service in either case the connection can be guarded by using the
SSL/TLS connection protocol. When a <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN>
decision needs to be made, Spocp uses the information provided in the
request as well as external information, needed to evaluate
constraints in the policy rules, in order to determine whether the
<SPAN LANG="en-US">request</SPAN> is to be granted or not.</P>
<P>The Spocp&nbsp; usage model
<SPAN LANG="en-US">follows</SPAN> the so called push sequence model,
that is the user connects to the resource and the resources checks
with Spocp to find out if the user is allowed to use the resource in
the way she wants to.<BR><BR>Spocp can act as a standalone server
<SPAN LANG="en-US">without</SPAN> any dependencies on other
resources.</P>
<H2><A NAME="background"></A><B>2.
Background </B>
</H2>
<P>With the continued development
of Internet based application services, it is no longer only the
experts in an application field or of an information system that are
users of the systems.<!--In order to take advantage of the self-service features,
  and to exploit the possibility to support the steps in our work processes, a
  large fraction of the personnel and persons that in other ways are affiliated
  with our organisation has to become users of our systems.-->
Instead more and more of the processes in an <SPAN LANG="en-US">organization</SPAN>
involve at least self-service components of these applications. They
are to a larger and larger extent supporting the everyday work
process. We are therefore quickly approaching a situation where every
member of every community affiliated with our <SPAN LANG="en-US">organization</SPAN>
need to be a user of our major information systems. Up until now this
has usually meant maintaining really large, separate, authentication
and <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN> <SPAN LANG="en-US">subsystems</SPAN>
(access control systems) - one for each of our Applications. When a
person moves within or leaves the <SPAN LANG="en-US">organization</SPAN>
the information about this person has to be changed or removed from
every system. 
</P>
<P>Our, and many other's, analysis
of this problem is that we need to start a development process aiming
at a situation where at least the &quot;amateur&quot; user
automatically are given authorities in our systems based on
attributes, <SPAN LANG="en-US">characterizing</SPAN> or describing
the individual, rather than on the identity of the particular
individual. 
</P>
<P>To reach that goal, we need</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">a
	good record of who belongs to our community 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">knowledge
	of what attributes and other information that <SPAN LANG="en-US">characterize</SPAN>
	and <SPAN LANG="en-US">categories</SPAN> the members of our
	community 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">a
	policy for how these attributes are assigned 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">an
	Information System where these attributes can be safely managed 
	</P>
	<LI><P>an attribute or role based
	<SPAN LANG="en-US">Authorization</SPAN> System, that can be served
	these attributes from a database or a directory. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>SPOCP is an <SPAN LANG="en-US">Authorization</SPAN>
Server designed to solve the last one of these bullets. It is
designed as a Network Based Infrastructural Service (a <SPAN LANG="en-US">Middleware</SPAN>
service) and we believe that SPOCP will prove quite useful, in
different deployment models, for a variety of applications and
application environments.<BR>It is worth noting that SPOCP is
designed to be able to use external information resources, such as an
enterprise directory, when evaluating policies. So in most cases
there should not be any need for duplicating information into SPOCP
that is already present in some accessible information resource.

<PRE>  In general, it is assumed that the parties who are participating in

<A NAME="4._Design_background"></A>4.Spocp
- the policy engine and the policy language</H2>
<P>The core of the SPOCP
<SPAN LANG="en-US">Authorization</SPAN> Server is a Policy Engine,
designed to decide if an <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN>
request (query) from an application satisfies the <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN>
policy for the particular application or not. Very basic to the
design of the SPOCP <SPAN LANG="en-US">Authorization</SPAN> Server
was the choice of S-expressions as the syntax for expressing the
rules of the policy as well as the <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN>
requests from the application. This approach was first conceived in
work done by a group within the <A HREF="http://www.sics.se/">Swedish
Institute of Computer Science</A>.
S-expressions were to our knowledge first described by Lampson and
Rivest in <A HREF="#SEXP">SEXP</A>
and <A HREF="#SDSI">SDSI</A>
in 1996, but its origin can be traced back further to LISP.
S-expressions were brought to our attention through the work of the
SPKI working group within the IETF.</P>
<P>A request satisfies the policy
if some rule in the policy permits the requested authority. Spocp
decides this by, for each rule in the policy, calculating whether the
query is less permissive than the rule. To say that a query is less
permissive than a rule shall be interpreted as that the policy rule
permits the authority requested and probably other and higher
authorities as well. The idea behind writing a policy is also just
that - with a &quot;small&quot; set of general rules, SPOCP shall be
able to permit a large number of specific requests. The calculation
is done by evaluating the formally defined Less-Permissive function.
It has been shown by&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~pki02/Bandmann/">Bandmann
and Dam</A> that an
<SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN> system based on a restricted
form of S-expressions and the Less-Permissive function will always
give formally correct advice to the querying application. It needs to
be stressed that the policy <SPAN LANG="en-US">engine only</SPAN>
bases its authority advice to the application on the result of the
evaluation of the Less-Permissive function - that is it makes purely
syntactic evaluations. It is the responsibility of the policy writer
to map an analysis of the <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN>
structure of the application to the syntax of S-expressions. 
</P>
<P>In authority structures the
concepts of appointments and delegations are central. By appointment
we mean assigning an authority you <SPAN LANG="en-US">do not</SPAN>
necessarily have yourself; - a person issuing driver's licenses does
not need to have a driver's license. By delegation we mean
transferring parts of your authority to someone else. Work by the
SICS <A HREF="http://www.sics.se/isl/pbr/papers/ConstraintDelegation.ps">group</A>
is also behind our approach to appointment and delegation.<BR><BR>In
a <SPAN LANG="en-US">Internet</SPAN> draft from 1997 <A HREF="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sexp.txt">Rivest</A>
describes three different representations of an S-expression: the
canonical, basic transport and advanced transport representation. The
Spocp client protocol uses the canonical representation while we in
this document will use the advanced transport representation, because
it is much more user friendly. We have also <SPAN LANG="en-US">choose</SPAN>
to leave out &quot;display hints&quot; since we really think that
'normal' users should never have to see S-expressions.</P>
<P>An example of an S-expression
policy rule is:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">(spocp (resource etc passwd)(action write)(subject (uid 0)))</PRE><P>
Which would mean that the subject
with uid 0 has write access to /etc/passwd.</P>
<P>S-expressions have a well
defined syntax but no defined semantics, that together with the fact
that one can build an engine that can compare two S-expressions and
answer the question whether one is equal or more specific than the
other is the basis of the SPOCP policy engine. <BR><BR>To understand
how this work one has to understand that an S-expression is made more
specific by adding an item to the end of a list.<BR><BR><I>(resource
etc password )</I> is for instance more specific than <I>(resource
etc) </I><BR><BR>Adding an item at some other place in a list creates
a different S-expression which is neither equal nor more
specific:<BR><BR><I>(resource usr etc)</I> is neither equal nor more
specific than <I>(resource etc)</I>. It is just different.</P>

Implementation issues 
</H2>
<P>In order to make SPOCP really
<SPAN LANG="en-US">useful</SPAN>, we have refrained from specifying
exactly one way of implementing the service. Instead SPOCP comes in a
number of different shapes. Differing in the closeness to the
application and also in the access protocol. In closeness order: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As
	a <EM>library</EM>
	which can be linked together with your application. A simple C API
	consisting of a small set of function calls are provided. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A
	<EM>standalone server</EM>
	that can listen to a <SPAN LANG="en-US">Unix</SPAN> domain socket or
	a <SPAN LANG="en-US">Internet</SPAN> IPv4/v6 port. Using TCP as
	transport protocol. The access protocol is the SPOCP client access
	protocol. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Through a access control
	module, like the <EM>Apache
	module</EM> - mod_spocp -
	where the Policy Engine is being a separate library module with a
	specified API.</P>
</UL>
<P>Why you would choose one setup
instead of another are factors like: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>speed</B>

</UL>
<P>We have <SPAN LANG="en-US">chosen</SPAN>
to maintain and store rules in a policy repository that is tightly
coupled to the policy engine. So in our world the <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN>
server always has all the policies in local storage.</P>
<P>Some of the information needed
to set up a complete Policy may not be available when the <SPAN LANG="en-US">modeling</SPAN>
is done, or there may be other reasons that some information may be
best provided through an external information source at the time of
testing whether a Query complies. This often occurs when a Constraint
is involved in the compliance test. SPOCP offers the possibility of
using what we term boundary conditions. Examples of such conditions
are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">date
	and time 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">information
	in an enterprise directory 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">information

</UL>
<H2><A NAME="policies"></A><B>6.
Creating Policies</B></H2>
<P>As stated above the SPOCP
policy engine does not care about the semantics of the policy or
request expressions. The policy engine only cares about whether the
rules and requests follow the S-expression syntax . Even so, as a
convention we have <SPAN LANG="en-US">so far</SPAN> used a structure
where the S-expressions consists of three parts: Subject, Action and
Resource, the following presentation is therefore tinted by that
choice. <BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>6.1 WWW policy structure</H3>
<P>In this example we are using
the resource, action and subject split as the basis for defining the
S-expression structure.</P>
<H4>6.1.1 WWW subject</H4>
Connections between a web client and server can be of 5 different types:
<OL>

<P>Depending on which type the

<P><BR>Given this matrix the
general S-expression definition of the subject could be:</P>

<BR><BR>In case of a http connection the subject part of the request

<P>The methods recognized by a web

limit ourself to stating that each method is represented by a number,
GET = 0, PUT = 1, POST = 2 and so on. The action definition would
then become:<BR><BR><I>(action &lt;num&gt;)<BR><BR>(action 0) </I>would
the represent the method GET.</P>
<H4><FONT SIZE=4>6.1.3 www

<P>Here there is a choice, one can
either use the filenames as they are &quot;/staff/index.html&quot; or
one can split the name into its parts &quot;staff&quot; and
&quot;index.html&quot;. In our mod_spocp implementation we have
choice the later. So the resource definition is:<BR><BR><I>(resource
&lt;filename part1&gt; &lt;filename part2&gt; ...)<BR><BR>(resource
public pictures rose.gif) </I>would then represent the file
&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/public/picture/rose.gif&nbsp; .<BR><BR>All put
together a GET request for the rose.gif file from a webclient at the
host&nbsp; hypatia.catalogix.se would then lead to the following
S-expression being sent to the Spocp server for evaluation:<BR><BR><I>(spocp
(resource public pictures rose.gif)(action 0)(subject (ip

The need to access external information</B></H2>
<P>In lots of cases information,
that is needed when a policy is to be <SPAN LANG="en-US">enforced</SPAN>,
is not present at the time when the rules as defined. Therefore a way
of 'referencing' this external information is needed. We have <SPAN LANG="en-US">chosen</SPAN>
to implement it as constrains that can be included in the rules and
which are evaluated/computed at the time when a request is
evaluated.<BR><BR>Equally common is the case that information is
already managed somewhere else. The organization might have a
enterprise directory where it keeps information about users, groups,
roles, organization structure and copying this information into rules
might cause more problems then it solves.<BR><BR>Also, if you want to
make rules active only at certain times, it might be more effective
to defined the time constrains in the rules and then have them
checked on evaluating the requests instead of adding and removing
them as the time goes.</P>
<H2><A NAME="appdel"></A>8.
Appointment and Delegation</H2>
<P>To illustrate the approach let
R<SUB>0</SUB> be some <SPAN LANG="en-US">authorization</SPAN> such as
the right to read document D. <BR>The unspecific right to read
document D can be expressed in a S-expression as:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">(spocp (resource D)(action read)(subject))</PRE><P>
Then the rule that allows A to
delegate the right can be expressed as 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">(spocp (resource R0)(action delegate)(subject A))</PRE><P>
Now, if we who have supreme power
wants to give A the right to delegate to B to delegate to someone
within the group G the right to read the document B, then this will
be done through the chain:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">R0: (spocp (resource D)(action read)(subject (group G)))
R1: (spocp (resource R0)(action delegate)(subject B))
R2: (spocp (resource R1)(action delegate)(subject A))</PRE><P>
Obvious from this example is that
the right to delegate a right never implicitly gives the right to use
a right. B or for that matter A, is according to the chain above no
allowed to read the file D unless they belong to the group G.</P>
